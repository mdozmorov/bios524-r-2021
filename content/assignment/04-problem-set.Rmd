# To do yourself

- [RMarkdown, knitr, best code practices](https://geanders.github.io/RProgrammingForResearch/reproducible-research-1.html)

- [RStudio v1.4 Preview: Visual Markdown Editing](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/30/rstudio-v1-4-preview-visual-markdown-editing/)

# To submit on blackboard, due 10-08-2020, 5:00pm

First, create an R Markdown document in which you will complete this assignment. Demonstrate your knowledge of R Markdown in the following ways:

- Produce a section header that says "R Markdown" and is bigger than normal text.
  - Within this section, produce a subsection header that is smaller than the section header and  says "R Markdown features". 
  - Write a sentence that includes bold text, italicized text, and normal text. (This will not be in a code chunk.)
  - Write a sentence that includes one inline R code in the sentence.
  - Link an image from your computer - that is school-appropriate - to be output when the document is knitted together.
  - Produce a 3x3 table with column headers just using text - no code chunk. (See Lecture 4 for a hint).
  
- Produce a section header that says "Statistical functions" and is bigger than normal text.

  - Read in the dataset 'warpbreaks'. It comes as a default with R. 
    - Fit a regression model of the number of breaks on the type of wool, the level of tension, and the interaction between wool and tension. 
    - Look at the summary. Interpret the results. 
    - Plot only the QQ-plot of this model. Then, provide code that would save it as a pdf to your computer.
    
  - Now, read in the 'UCBAdmissions' dataset, which comes as default with R.
    - Only keep the admissions data from Department A.
    - Run a chi-squared test of independence between gender and admittance. Comment on the results.
    
  - Going to simulate some data now. Set a seed for reproducibility.
    - Generate $1000$ observations from a Normal distribution with parameters $\mu=5, \sigma=2$.
    - Plot the empirical cdf of these data. Add a horizontal line in red at the $0.8$ mark on the y-axis.
    - Use R's statistical distribution functions to determine the $80^{th}$ percentile of the above normal distribution, and store it in a variable called q80. 
      - Add a point to the plot that has x-coordinate equal to the $80^{th}$ percentile of your sample data and y-coordinate equal to $0.8$. Fill it in with some color.
      - Add another point that has x-coordinate equal to q80 and y-coordinate equal to $0.8$. Fill it in with another color.
      - Think about what all this means.
