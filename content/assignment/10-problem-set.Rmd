# To do yourself

- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) book by Hadley Wickham. [GitHub](https://github.com/jcheng5/shiny-book)

- [awesome-rshiny](https://github.com/grabear/awesome-rshiny) - a list of resources to learn R Shiny

- [How to Deploy R Shiny App for Free on Shinyapps.io](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/10/how-to-deploy-r-shiny-app-for-free-on-shinyapps-io-video/) 14 min video and links

# To submit on Blackboard, before 5:00pm on 2020-10-29

- Open [r-shiny.Rmd](../../slides/r-shiny.Rmd) in RStudio. Review the code chunks and create an `app.R` file from them. Ensure the app runs. Submit the file.

- Create a very small and limited Shiny app, using some default dataset in R. The only requirements are that the app:
  - Has a descriptive title
  - Explores/visualizes one aspect of the dataset
  - Runs without errors.
