## Spreadsheets

- Store data in text files, delimiter-separated

- Spreadsheets may be used for data entry and storage

- Analysis and visualization should happen outside of spreadsheets

## General spreadsheet tips

- Use a consistent data layout in multiple files
    - Your primary data file should contain just the data and nothing else: no calculations, no graphs

- Enter one piece of information in one cell
    - Don't use formatting, e.g., coloring, to convey additional meaning to the cell value. Instead, add another column, e.g., "outlier" with a boolean `TRUE` or `FALSE` indicator variable

- Use a consistent format for all dates, YYYY-MM-DD recommended
    - Use "Text" format where possible, to avoid autoreformatting, e.g., "SEPT9" will become "9/9/2020" displayed as "9-Sep"
    - Use "\`forward tick" trick to force text format
    
---
## General spreadsheet tips (cont.)

- Fill in all cells. No empty cells
    - Use a consistent fixed code for any missing values, e.g. "NA". Don't use numerical values like 999

- Use consistent file names for similar datasets
    - Never include “final” in a file name

- Save and distribute the data in plain text files
    - Use comma-delimited (CSV) format

---
## Variable naming conventions

- Avoid using spaces in column/row names. Use some filler instead, e.g., "." or "_"

- Note that `read.csv()`, `read.table` and the like functions will silently replace spases with dots in column names

```{r}
column_names_with_spaces <- c("First column", "Second column")
make.names(column_names_with_spaces)
```

## Spreadsheet horror stories

<img src="http://www.eusprig.org/images/logo.jpg" height=100>

- A public archive of spreadsheet “horror stories”

- In 13 audits of real-world spreadsheets, an average of 88% spreadsheets contained errors (Panko, Raymond R. "[What we know about spreadsheet errors](https://www.igi-global.com/article/know-spreadsheet-errors/55750)." Journal of Organizational and End User Computing (JOEUC) 10, no. 2 (1998): 15-21.)

## Project organization principles

- One project = one folder
    - Create readable names for subfolders/code. E.g. `00_raw_data`, `01_raw_data_QC` etc.
    - Choose file names carefully. Don't put spaces and special characters in file names!

- Be sure to get and keep any/all data and meta-data possible

- Get the data in the most-raw form possible. Keep the original files, names intact. (gzipped) CSV Text format is the most preferable

- Separate data from code. Use relative paths in code. Create multiple `README.md` and write notes - your future you will thank you

## Another project organization idea

``` bash
project/
| data/
| | processing_scripts
| | raw/
| | proc/
| tools/
| | src/
| | bin/
| exps
| | pipeline_scripts
| | results/
| | analysis_scripts
| | figures/
```

---
## And another project organization idea

``` bash
project/
| 00_raw/
| 01_processed/
| 02_summary/
| 01_process.sh
| 02_summary.sh
| README.md
```

---
## Folder organization

- Your project folder dictates relative paths of all files and subfolders
- Use relative paths, e.g., `read_csv("data/matrix.txt")`
- Set your project folder as a variable; if a project is transferred to another computer, there will be only ove variable to change
``` r
dirMain <-"/path/to/my/project" # On Windows, can use \\
setwd(dirMain) # Set working directory. Check ?getwd
list.files(path = dirMain) $ List files
```
- You can construct explicit paths like `file.path(dirMain, "data/matrix.txt")`

---
## Project organization principles

- **Script everything** - All analysis steps, including data cleaning (removal of outliers, correcting numbers, typos, renaming columns etc.) should be scripted

- **Scalability and universality** - ask yourself a question, if the data are updated (e.g., additional subjects) or you find some artifact that needs fixing, can you just “press a button” to update? If you work on a similar project, can you reuse your existing scripts with minimal modifications?

- **Document everything** - Text format, human readable. Explicitly tie files together. Have a plan to organize, store and make your work understandable by others

---
## File naming principles

- Machine readable

- Human readable

- Plays well with default ordering

.small[http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/records/electronicrecords/erfnaming.php]

---
## File naming: Machine readable

- Regular expression and globbing friendly
    - Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity
    - Easy to compute on
- Deliberate use of delimiters, e.g. "-", "\_" (think `cut -d "_" -f1,3,5`, `grep Notes` commands)
    
``` bash
2018-05-16_Lecture_Slides_01.pdf
2018-05-16_Lecture_Notes_01.pdf
2018-05-16_Lecture_Slides_02.pdf
2018-05-16_Lecture_Notes_02.pdf
```

---
## File naming: Human readable

- Name contains info on content

- Easy to figure out what something is, based on its name

``` bash
01_preprocessing.R
02_quality-control.R
helper01_rename-files.sh
helper02_merge-duplicates.py
```

---
## File naming summary

- Plays well with default ordering
    - Put something numeric first
    - Left pad numbers with zeros
    - Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates (YYYY-MM-DD _or_ YYMMDD)

Good
``` bash
2018-05-16_Lecture_Slides_01.pdf
2018-05-16_Lecture_Notes_01.pdf
```
Bad
``` bash
10_final-figures.R
1_data-cleaning.R
2_quality-control.R
```

## Data management

- Save the raw data

- Ensure that raw data are backed up in more than one location

- Create the data you wish to see in the world

- Create analysis-friendly data

- Record all the steps used to process data

- Anticipate the need to use multiple tables, and use a unique identifier for every record

- Submit data to a reputable DOI - issuing repository so that others can access and cite it

---
## Data management

- Data are cheap, time is expensive

    - A terabyte hard drive costs about US $50 retail, which means that 50 Gigabytes costs less than US $5

    - How much of your time is needed to generate 50Gb of code?
