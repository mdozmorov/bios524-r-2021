## Reproducible Research

Good science is built on research that may be reproduced (or copied) by other researchers (and yourself!)

- If another researchers read your report, could they reproduce your work?

- Could you reproduce your own analysis after a year? two?

#### Tips for Reproducible Research

- Document all you do and use your code as the documentation

- Make figures, tables, and statistics the result of scripts

- Keep an entire project in a single directory that is version controlled

---
## Keeping History of Changes

Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects

- Backup of your entire project

- Promotes transparency

- Facilitates reproducibility

- Faster recovery from errors

- Easier collaborations

&lt;!--
## Why Version Control?

- Version control is not strictly necessary for reproducible research, and it’s admittedly some extra work (to learn and to use) in the short term, but the long term benefits are enormous

- People are more resistant to version control than to any other tool, because of the short-term effort and the lack of recognition of the long-term benefits

- Imagine that some aspect of your code has stopped working at somepoint. You know it was working in the past, but it’s not working now. How easy is it to figure out where the problem was introduced?
--&gt;

---
## What is Git?

- Git is an open-source distributed version control system
    * Developed by Linus Torvalds (developer of Linux)
    
- Distributed, distinct from centralized (subversion)
    * Authors can work asynchronously without being connected to a central server and synchronize their changes when possible
    
- Complete audit trail of changes, including authorship

- Freedom to explore new ideas without disturbing the main line of work

- Collaborate with elegance – on any file at any time

---
## Advantages of version control:

- It’s easy to set up

- Every copy of a Git repository is a full backup of a project and its history

- A few easy-to-remember commands are all you need for most day-to-day version control tasks

---
## Git lifecycle

.center[&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/seHhY.png" height=500 &gt;]

.small[ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6143285/git-add-vs-push-vs-commit ]

---
## Setting up Git

Download and install Git, https://git-scm.com/downloads

Do not install GUI client

- `man git` - not always good
- `git --help [&lt;command&gt;]`

---
## Setting up git (once)

- `git config --global user.name "Your name here”`
- `git config --global user.email your_email@example.com`
- `git config --global color.ui “auto”`
- `git config core.fileMode false`
- `git config --list`

---
## Git Concepts

Two main concepts

1. **commit** -  a recorded snapshot of differences you made to your project’s files
2. **repository** - the history of all your project’s commits

Files can be stored in a project’s working directory (*which users see*) the staging area (*where the next commit is being built up*) and the local repository (*where revisions are permanently recorded*)

.center[&lt;img src="img/Gitflow.png" height=250 &gt;]

---
## Starting a Git Repository

Exercise:

- Make a folder. Check with `ls`

- `git init` - initializes a repository

- `.git` folder contains all Git info - keep it intact

- `git status` - to see the status of your repository.

---
## How the files travel

**Lifecycle of files in Git repository**

- Untracked

- Modified

- Staged

- Committed

---
## Tracking Changes

- `git add` - puts files in the staging area

- `git commit` - saves the changes in the files on staging area to the local repository

- Always write an informative commit message when committing changes, "-m" flag

- `git status` - shows the status of a repository

.center[&lt;img src="img/Gitflow.png" height=250 &gt;]

---
## What to Add

**New repository from scratch**

The first file to create (and `add` and `commit`) is probably a `README.md` file, either as plain text or with Markdown, describing the project

**A new repo from an existing project folder**

Say you’ve got an existing project that you want to start tracking with git. Go into the directory containing the project

- Type `git init` – itinializes empty repository
- Type `git add &lt;file&gt; [&lt;file&gt; &lt;file&gt; …]` - start tracking all the relevant files
- Type `git commit` – saves the snapshot of your current files

---
## What NOT to Add

`git add`, `git add –u` – add all the changes (updates) in your files

- Things not to version control are large data files that never change, binary files (including Word and Excel documents), and the output of your code

- Git works best with text files, like code, you can see differences

- Exercise: commit an image file, overwrite it with another, do `git diff`

- `git rm &lt;file&gt;` - removes a file from the current and future commits, but it remains in history/repository

- The `.gitignore` file tells Git what files to ignore. `git add -f` forces adding

---
## Ignoring Unnecessary Files

- The various files in your project directory that you may not want to track will show up as such in `git status`

- Unnecessary files should be indicated in a `.gitignore` file

- Each subdirectory can have its own `.gitignore` file

---
## Ignoring Unnecessary Files

Also, you can have a global `gitignore`, such in your home directory, e.g. `~/.gitignore_global`, which contains:

`*~`

`.*~`

`.DS_Store`

`.Rhistory`

`.Rdata`

`.Rproj`

You have to tell git about the global `.gitignore_global` file: `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`

---
## Committing large files

- Large files should not be included to Git repository

- Solutions for versioning large files without actually saving the file with Git
    - Git Large File Storage (LFS)

- General principle - store large files separately, keep pointers to them in a repository, synchronize when needed

.small[ https://git-lfs.github.com/ ]

---
## When to Commit

- In the same way that it is wise to often save a document that you are working on, so too is it wise to save numerous revisions of your code

- More frequent commits increase the granularity of your “undo” button

- Good commits are atomic: they are the smallest change that remain meaningful

.center[&lt;img src="img/Gitflow.png" height=250 &gt;]

.small[ http://blog.no-panic.at/2014/10/20/funny-initial-git-commit-messages/ 

http://www.slideshare.net/rubentan/how-we-git-commit-policy-and-code-review ]

---
## When to Commit

1. One commit = one idea or one change (one feature/task/function to be fixed/added)

2. Make and test the change

3. Add and commit

As a rule of thumb, a good size for a single change is a group of edits that you could imagine wanting to undo in one step at some point in the future

---
## Best Practices

- A good commit message usually contains a one-line description of the changes since the last commit and indicating their purpose

- Informative commit messages will serve you well someday, so make a habit of never committing changes without at least a one-sentence description

.center[&lt;img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit_2x.png" height=250 &gt;]

.small[ https://xkcd.com/1296/ ]

---
## Anatomy of Git Commits

- Each commit is identified by a unique “name” - SHA-1 hashtag

- SHA-1 is an algorithm that takes some data and generates a unique string from it

- SHA-1 hashes are 40 characters long

- Different data will always produce different hashes

- The same data will produce exactly the same hash

---
## Exploring History

`git log` - lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order

Flags       | Function
------------| ------
`-p`        | shows changes between commits
`-3`        | last 3 commits, any number works
`--stat`    | shows comparative number of insertions/deletions between commits
`--oneline` | just SHA-1 and commit messages
`--graph`   | prettier output
`--pretty`  | short/full/fuller/oneline

---
## Exactly what changes have you made?

- `git diff` – shows all changes that have been made from a previous commit, in all files

- `git diff R/modified.R` - see your changes of a particular file

- To see the differences between commits, use hashtags: `git diff 0da42ba  5m5lpac`

- The differences between commits for a specific file can be checked using `git diff HEAD~2 HEAD -- &lt;file&gt;`

---
## Undoing/Unstaging

- There are a number of ways that you may accidentally stage a file that you don't want to commit

`git add password.txt`

- Check with status to see that it is added but not committed

- You can now unstage that file with:

`git reset password.txt`

- Check with `git status`

---
## Undoing: Discarding Changes

Perhaps you have made a number of changes that you realize are not going anywhere.  Add what you ate for breakfast to `README.md`. Check with status to see that the file is changed and ready to be added

You can now return to previous committed version with:

`git checkout -- README.md`

Check with status and take a look at the file

You can return to a version of the file in a specific commit

`git checkout m5ks3l8 README.md`

If you want to correct the last commit message, do

`git commit --amend -m "New commit message"`

---
## Undoing: removing from the repo

Sometimes you want to remove a file from the repository after committing. Create a file called `READYOU.md`, and add/commit it to the repository

You can now remove the file from the repository with:

`git rm READYOU.md`

List the directory to see that you have no file named `READYOU.md`. Use `git status` to determine if you need any additional steps

What if you delete a file in the shell without `git rm`? 

`rm README.md`

What does git status say?

Oops! You can recover this important file with `git checkout -- README.md`

---
## Undoing: the big "undo"

It is possible that after many commits, you decide that you really want to "rollback" a set of commits and start over. It is easy to revert all your code to a previous version

You can use `git log` and `git diff` to explore your history and determine which version you are interested in. Choose a version and note the hash for that version

`git revert b5l9sa4`

Importantly, this will not erase the intervening commits. This will create a new commit that is changed from the previous commit by a change that will recreate the desired version. This retains a complete provenance of your software, and be compared to the prohibition in removing pages from a lab notebook

---
## Branches

Branches are parallel instances of a repository that can be edited and version controlled in parallel, without disturbing the main branch

They are useful for developing a feature, working on a bug, trying out an idea

If it works out, you can merge it back into the main and if it doesn’t, you can trash it

.center[&lt;img src="https://hades.github.io/media/git/git-history.png" height=300 &gt;]

.small[ https://hades.github.io/2010/01/git-your-friend-not-foe-vol-2-branches/ ]

---
## Typical Branch Workflow

`git branch` – list current branch(es). An asterisk (*) indicates which branch you’re currently in.

`git branch test_feature` - create a branch called test_feature:

`git checkout test_feature` – switch to the test_feature branch

Make various modifications, and then add and commit.

`git checkout main` - go back to the main branch

`git merge test_feature` – combine changes made in the test_feature branch with the main branch

`git branch –d test_feature` – deletes the test_feature branch

---
## Branches for Collaboration

Multiple authors can work on parallel branches, even on the same document

Conflicts must be resolved manually (using human intelligence)

.center[&lt;img src="img/collabbranches.png" height=250 &gt;]

.small[ Ram, Karthik. “[Git Can Facilitate Greater Reproducibility and Increased Transparency in Science](https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0473-8-7.” Source Code for Biology and Medicine 8, no. 1 (2013) ]

---
## What if two people have made changes to the repository? 

- Imagine that your collaborator makes a change to a file, commits it locally, and pushes to GitHub
- Meanwhile you also make a different change to the same file and also commit locally
    - When you try to push your commit to GitHub, you will fail because there are commits on GitHub that you do not have. You must pull from GitHub first
    - The good news is that quite often, this will “just work”, i.e. the GitHub version and your version will merge cleanly
- Git is quite clever at reconciliation and changes to different files or even distinct parts of the same file will merge
- This derives from the “diff” based model of Git described earlier. After a successful merge, you can push your changes and the cycle goes on.

---
## Resolving conflicts

Conflicts may occur when two or more people change the same content in a file at the same time

`Auto-merging README.md`

`CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md`

`Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result`

---
## Resolving Conflicts

The version control system does not allow people to blindly overwrite each other’s changes. Instead, it highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved. If you try to push while there are some changes, your push will be rejected, need to pull first. Pull, conflicts, resolve manually.

`&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD`

`Your current changes`

`=======`

`Conflicting changes need to be resolved`

# GitHub

---
## GitHub

- GitHub is a hosting service where many people store their open (and closed) source code repositories. It provides tools for browsing, collaborating on and documenting code

- Like facebook for programmers

- Free 2-year ”micro” account for students - https://education.github.com/ - free private repositories. Alternatively - Bitbucket, GitLab, gitolite

- Exercise: Create a GitHub account, https://github.com/

.small[ [Bitbucket vs GitHub vs GitLab](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitbucket-vs-github-vs-gitlab/) ]

---
## Why use GitHub?

- True open source

- Graphical user interface for git is built into RStudio

- Exploring code and its history

- Tracking issues

- Facilitates: Learning from others, seeing what people are up to, and contributing to others’ code

- Lowers the barrier to collaboration: ”There’s a typo in your documentation.” vs.”Here’s a correction for your documentation.”

---
## RStudio and GitHub

RStudio has built-in facilities for git and GitHub. See "Tools -&gt; Global Options"

.center[&lt;img src="img/rstudiogithub.png" height=250 &gt;]

- Your Rstudio project can be your git repository
- Create a project with checkbox “Create a git repository” checked
- Add existing project to version control by selecting git in "Tools -&gt; Version control -&gt; Project setup"

---
## RStudio and GitHub

Basic commands are available:

- See which files are untracked, modified, stage
- What branch you are in
- Add files, commit, push/pull
- See differences, history
- Revert changes, ignore files
- For heavy lifting git, use shell

.center[&lt;img src="img/rstudiogithub2.png" height=250 &gt;]

---
## Adding collaborators to your repository

- On your repository page, click "Settings" tab

- Go to "Collaborators," confirm your password

- Search by username, full name or email address in the provided field, and click "Add collaborator"

- Now, this individual can push to your repository

.small[ https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/ ]

---
## Remotes in GitHub

A local Git repository can be connected to one or more remote repository
`git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame`

Check your work `git remote -v`

Use the `https://` protocol (not `git@github.com`) to connect to remote repositories until you have learned how to set up SSH

`git push origin main` - copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository

`git pull origin main` - copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository

---
## Asynchronous Collaboration

- "FORK" someone’s repository on GitHub – this is now YOUR copy

- `git clone` it on your computer

- Make changes, `git add`, `git commit`

- `git push` changes to your copy

- Create "NEW PULL REQUEST" on GitHub

.small[ https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/ ]

---
## Keeping in sync with the owner's repo

Add a connection to the original owner’s repository

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/username/reponame # 'upstream' - alias to other repo`

`git remote –v` - check what you have

`git pull upstream main` – pull changes from the owner’s repo

Make changes, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`

Question: Where will they go? Can you do git push upstream main?

---
## Create Pull Request

Go to your version of the repository on GitHub

Click the "NEW PULL REQUEST" button at the top

Note that the owner’s repository will be on the left and your repository will be on the right

Click the "CREATE NEW PULL REQUEST" button. Give a succinct and informative title, in the comment field give a short explanation of the changes and click the green button “CREATE PULL REQUEST” again

---
## What others see/do with pull requests

The owner goes to his version of the repository. Clicks on "PULL REQUESTS" at the top. A list of pull requests made to his repo comes up

Click on the particular request. The owner can see other’s comments on the pull request, and can click to see the exact changes

If the owner wants someone to make further changes before merging, he add a comment

If the owner hates the idea, he just click the “Close” button

If the owner loves the idea, he clicks the “Merge pull request”

---
## Track and Resolve Issues

- Issues keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects
- They can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team
- Written in Markdown, can refer to @collaborator, #other_issue

.center[&lt;img src="img/issues.png" height=250 &gt;]

- Can use commit messages to fix issues, e.g., `“Add missing tab, fix #100”`. Use any keyword, `“Fixes”, “Fixed”, “Fix”, “Closes”, “Closed”, or “Close”`

---
## Be a stargazer, or a watcher, or both

- Starring allows users to mark repositories of interest to them, but they do not receive notifications about changes in those repositories

- Watching provides more detailed notifications on repositories
    - Time investment to follow and understand the changes
    - Knowledge gained is much deeper

.small[ Sheoran, Jyoti, Kelly Blincoe, Eirini Kalliamvakou, Daniela Damian, and Jordan Ell. “[Understanding ‘Watchers’ on GitHub](https://doi.org/10.1145/2597073.2597114),” 336–39. ACM Press, 2014.]

# GitHub actions

---
## GitHub actions

Much of the software engineering and continuous integration (CI) will be done through GitHub Actions.

- GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. 
- GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. 
    - For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.

.small[ https://github.com/features/actions 

Workflow examples https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows ]

---
## GitHub actions

- For publicly available repositories, GitHub provides free limited minutes for executing GH actions

- Signing up for the GitHub academic plans provides additional free minutes.
    - [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/)
    - [Academic/Researcher plans](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/use-github-in-your-classroom-and-research/about-github-education-for-educators-and-researchers)

---
## The components of GitHub Actions

.pull-left[
- The **workflow** is an automated procedure that you add to your repository. 

- Workflows are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event. 

- The workflow can be used to build, test, package, release, or deploy a project on GitHub. 

- You can reference a workflow within another workflow.

]

.small[ https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions ]

---
## The components of GitHub Actions

An **event** is a specific activity that triggers a workflow. For example, activity can originate from GitHub when someone pushes a commit to a repository or when an issue or pull request is created.

A **job** is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Cab be run in parallel (default), or sequentially.

A **step** is an individual task that can run commands in a job. A step can be either an action or a shell command. 

**Actions** are standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job. Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow. You can create your own actions, or use actions created by the GitHub community.

A **runner** is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed. Can use different OSs.

.small[ https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions ]

---
## GitHub actions file

- A GitHub Actions file lives in the `.github/workflows` folder. E.g., `github-actions-demo.yml` (reusable for other projects)
- YAML format defines commands.

Set your workflow to run on push events to the main and release/* branches

``` yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
```

---
## Running your workflow on different operating systems

GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

To set the operating system for your job, specify the operating system using `runs-on`:

``` yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    name: deploy to staging
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
```

The available virtual machine types are: `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-18.04`, or `ubuntu-16.04`, `windows-latest` or `windows-2019`, `macos-latest` or `macos-10.15`

Jobs can be run on multiple operating systems (matrix of OSs)

---
## Run a command

``` yaml
- name: Query dependencies
  run: install.packages('remotes')
```

Use steps witm multiple jobs. Jobs can share data, depend on the results of other jobs

``` yaml
jobs:
  example-job:
    steps:
      - name: Run build script
        run: ./.github/scripts/build.sh
        shell: bash
```

---
## GitHub actions file

``` yaml
name: learn-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
```

# SSH

---
## Connecting to GitHub with SSH

- Typically GitHub using the HTTPS protocol, e.g. https://github.com/mdozmorov/MDnotes. However, it requires you to enter your username and password when communicating with GitHub

- You’ll want to consider switching to the SSH protocol once you are regularly using Git in command line (git@github.com:mdozmorov/MDnotes.git)

- Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services

- With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username or password at each visit

.small[ https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/ ]

---
## Encryption Concepts

- Both public and private keys are generated by one individual – they are yours

- A public key is a “lock” that can be opened with the corresponding private key

- Public key can be placed on any other computer you want to connect to, Private key stays private on any machine you’ll be connecting from

- Only your private key can “open” your public key

.center[&lt;img src="img/keys.png" height=200 &gt;]

.small[ https://wogan.me/tag/public-key-encryption/ ]

---
## Getting Public and Private Keys

Generate your public and private keys

First, check if you already have them:

`ls -al ~/.ssh`

If not, generate:

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C your_email@example.com`

---
## Getting Public and Private Keys

.center[&lt;img src="img/keys.png" height=150 &gt;]

~/.ssh/id_rsa &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

.center[&lt;img src="img/keys2.png" height=200 &gt;]

~/.ssh/authorized_keys 

---
## Add Public Key to GitHub

Go to your GitHub Account Settings

- Click “SSH and GPG keys” on the left, then “New SSH Key” on the right

- Add a label (like “My laptop”) and paste your public key into the text box

- Test it, `ssh -T git@github.com`. You should see something like “Hi username! You've successfully authenticated but Github does not provide shell access.”

.center[&lt;img src="img/GitHubkey.png" height=250 &gt;]

.small[ https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/ 

https://www.cs.utah.edu/~bigler/code/sshkeys.html ]

---
## Add Public Key to any Machine

- Copy your public key `~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub` to a remote machine 

- Add the content of your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine

- Make sure the `.ssh/authorized_keys` has the right permissions (read+write for user, nothing for group and all)

`cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh user@remote.machine.com 'mkdir -p .ssh; cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 600 authorized_keys'`

---
## Password-less login

Your private key should be visible to your terminal session

Start SSH agent. Or, add auto-start function in your `~/.bashrc`
