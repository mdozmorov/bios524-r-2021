## Summary of the previous class

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Objects]

- Everything that exists in R is an **object**
- Everything that happens in R is a **call to a function**
- The assignment operator: ` <- `, preferred over ` = `  
- Do not name objects with [Reserved Words in R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) like `if else while function for TRUE FALSE NULL Inf NaN NA`
]
.panel[.panel-name[Object types]
.can-edit[
- Scalars, `a <- 3.14`
- Vectors, `b <- c(1, 2)` or `b <- c(1, "2")`
    - Vectors can be named, `names(b) <- c("First", "Second")`. Use `unname()` to remove.
- Matrices, `mat <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)`
- Data frames, `dat = data.frame(Column.1 = c(3, 1, 3), Column.2 = c("2", "3", "2"))`
- Boolean, `TRUE` or `FALSE`
- Factors, `factor(c("Cats", "Dogs"), levels = c("Dogs", "Cats"))`
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Subsetting]

.can-edit[
- Access to elements using `[]`
- Row/column indexes start from 1, `dat[1, 2]`
- Columns in data frames can be accessed with `$`, `dat$Column.1`
- Elements can be subsetted using Boolean indexes, `a[c(TRUE, FALSE)]`
- Avoid spaces in column names, as well as numerical column names
    - If absolutely necessary, wrap column names in forward ticks, `dat$1`
]
]
.panel[.panel-name[Auxillary functions]

.can-edit[
- `class(a)`, `str(a)`, `is.character(a)`, `as.character(b)`
- `dim(dat)`, `nrow(dat)`, `ncol(dat)`, `length(dat)`, `colnames(dat)`, `rownames(dat)`
- `head()`, `tail()`, `summary()`
- Use `?` on any function to get help, `?cor`
- Type function name without parentheses to see its code, `cor`
]
]
]

---
## Sequences of elements

```{r}
rep(c(1, 2, 3), 5)
seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 2)
1:5
5:1
```

---
## Sequences of characters

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Sequence of characters]
```{r eval=FALSE}
"a":"e"
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Results]
```{r eval=FALSE}
"a":"e"
Error in "a":"e" : NA/NaN argument
In addition: Warning messages:
1: NAs introduced by coercion 
2: NAs introduced by coercion 
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Solutions]
.can-edit[
```{r}
head(letters)
tail(LETTERS)
month.abb
month.name
pi
```
]
]
]

---
## Lists

- **Lists**: objects containing elements of different types
    - Each list element can be of different length
    
```{r}
lst = list(A = rep(2, 5), B = seq(1:5), C = letters[1:10])
lst
unlist(lst)
```

---
## Addressing elements in a list

- Address any element as `lst[1]` (or, `lst["A"]`)

```{r}
lst[1]
```

- Address _the content of any element_ as `lst[[1]]` (or, `lst[["A"]]`, `lts$A`)

```{r}
lst[[1]]
```

---
## Logical operators

.can-edit[
```{r eval=FALSE}
3 < 4 & "a" == "b"
```
]

- Like arithmetic operations, logic statements follow the order of preference. Operators `>`, `==`, `!` etc. are evaluated before `&` and `|`
- If in doubt, wrap your expressions in parentheses

.can-edit[
```{r eval=FALSE}
(3 < 4) & ("a" == "b")
```
]

---
## Logical operators

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Evaluation]

```{r}
1 + 2 == 3
```

What do you think will happen if we evaluate `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3`?

]
.panel[.panel-name[Caveats]
```{r}
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
```

**Problem:** Computers represent numbers as binary (i.e. base 2) floating-points. [Read more](https://floating-point-gui.de/basic/)

**Solution:** Use `all.equal()` for evaluating floats (i.e fractions).

```{r}
all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
```

]

]

---
## Value matching

- To see whether an object is contained within (i.e. matches one of) a list of items, use `%in%`

```{r}
5 %in% 1:10
1:10 %in% 5
```

- Value matching can be useful to subset R objects

```{r}
pvals <- c(0.05, 0.04, 0.09, 0.03, 0.12)
pvals[pvals <= 0.05]
```


---
## Comments

R ignores everything after the `#` sign

```{r}
# This line is a comment
print("Hello, World!") # This will print the message, but the comment will be ignored
```

---
## Clean up your environment

```{r}
z <- c(1, 2, 3)
ls()
rm(z) # Remove one variable
ls()
# Remove everything from the environment
rm(list = ls()) # Not the same as restarting R session
ls()
```


---
## Functions

- A function is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task
    - **Name** - the actual name of the function, e.g., `summary()`, `mean()`
    - **Arguments** - values passed to the functions. Argument-less functions exist
    - **Code** - actual code of the function
    - **Return value** - the result of the function's code execution

``` r
read.csv(file="scores.csv")
```

`read.csv` is a function to import a CSV file, and `file` is an argument that specifies which file to import

R has a large number of built-in functions, and the user can create their own functions

---
## Running functions

- From the R console - type the function and hit Enter
    - One function at a time, not efficient

- Using an `R` script - a text file that contains all your `R` functions/code
    - `R` scripts allow you to save, edit, reproduce and share your code
    - R scripts stored in files with `.R` extension
    - Run the whole script as `source("script_name.R")`, or, from command line, `Rscript script_name.R`
    - In RStudio, you can run individual lines, code chunks, or source whole scripts. Keyboard shortcuts are available

---
## Packages

- All functions belong to *packages*. The `read.csv` function is in the `utils` package.

- `R` comes with about 30 packages (called "base `R`"), but as of August 2021, there are over 18,000 CRAN packages and over 2,000 Bioconductor packages

- Example: `ggplot2` is a popular package that adds functions for creating graphs in a different way than what base `R` provides

- To use functions in a package, the package must be installed and loaded. (They're free)
- You only _install_ a package once
- You _load_ a package whenever you want to use its functions

---
## Package repositories

- `CRAN` - Comprehensive R Archive Network – a collection of > 18,000 (September 2021) packages

- `Bioconductor` – genomics-oriented free and open source project hosting > 2,000 specialized R packages (September 2021)

- `MRAN` - Microsoft R Application Network, includes CRAN packages and more

- `GitHub` – code-hosting repository, packages for everyone and by everyone

.small[ https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ 

https://www.bioconductor.org/

https://mran.microsoft.com/

https://github.com/  ]

---
## Installing packages

- `install.packages(“<package_name>”)` - installs packages from CRAN, e.g., `install.packages("BiocManager")`

- `install.packages(“<package_name.tar.gz>”, repos = NULL)` – install from a tarball archive

- `R CMD INSTALL <package_name.tar.gz>` - install from a command line

- `remotes` package - installs R packages from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Bioconductor, or plain 'subversion' or 'git' repositories. E.g., `remotes::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")`

- `BiocManager::install()` - Install or update Bioconductor, CRAN, or GitHub packages

.small[ https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BiocManager ]

---
## Installing packages

- `AnVIL::install()` - Install package binaries, speeds up installation process

- RStudio point-and-click interface

.center[<img src="img/rstudio_snippets.png" height=400 >]

---
## Loading packages

- `library()` will load the package, e.g., `library(readxl)` or `library("readxl")`
    - But, when installing packages, always use parentheses, e.g., `install.packages("readxl")`

- `require()` will load the package and, if success, return TRUE. Useful in `if` statement, e.g.

``` r
if (!require(ggplot2)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
```

---
## Loading packages

- `library(package_name)` – load library to use its functions

- `library()` vs. `require()`
    - `require()` _tries_ to load the package, returns TRUE or FALSE
    - `library()` just loads the package, fails if the package is not available

- Use only `library(package_name)`

.small[ https://yihui.name/en/2014/07/library-vs-require/ ]

---
## Using functions from other packages

- You can access functions without loading the package using the `::` operator, e.g., `Hmisc::rcorr()`

- Entering the function name without parentheses will output its code

``` r
> data.frame
function (..., row.names = NULL, check.rows = FALSE, check.names = TRUE, 
    fix.empty.names = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors()) 
{
    data.row.names <- if (check.rows && is.null(row.names)) 
...
```

- You can access internal functions of a package with the `:::` operator if you know their name

---
## Getting help

- Use `?function_name` to get help on a function from a _loaded_ package. E.g., `?boxplot` (same as `help(boxplot)`)
    - Use `example(boxplot)` to see how the function can be used

- Use `??function_name` to search for the function across all installed packages, even not loaded. E.g., `??ggplotly`

- Get an overview of all functions in a package: `help(package = "dplyr")`

---
## Getting help

- For many packages, you can also try the `vignette()` function, which will provide an introduction to a package and it's purpose through a series of helpful examples. E.g., `vignette("dplyr")`
    - Bioconductor packages have vignettes, short tutorials on package-specific tasks. Browse them, e.g., `browseVignettes(package = "limma")`

- Some packages have interactive demos. List all such packages with `demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))`, use as `demo("fibonacci", package = "future")`

---
## Useful ways of getting data in and out of R

- Base functions: `read.table`, `read.csv`, `write.table`, `write.csv`

- Tidyverse way, `readr` package: `read_table`, `read_csv`, `read_tsv`, `write_csv` ...

- For fixed-width files, use `read.fwf` or `readr::read_fwf` funcitons

- For reading/writing Excel files, use `readxl` and `writexl` packages, `read_xlsx`, `write_xlsx` functions
    - Remember that `.csv` is the preferred text-based format that opens in Excel

.small[https://readr.tidyverse.org/

https://readxl.tidyverse.org/

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=writexl]

---
## The stringsAsFactors curse

- When creating data frames with `data.frame()` or reading data with `read.table()`, strings automatically converted to factors

- This behind-the-scenes factor conversion can lead to unpredictable behaviors

- Use `as.is = TRUE` in `read.table()` to avoid such conversion

- Better yet, set `options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)` at the beginning of your script files

.small[https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/02/16/stringsasfactors/]

---
## Save/load R objects

- `save()`, `load()` - saves/loads R objects to the specified file
``` r
x <- stats::runif(20)
y <- list(a = 1, b = TRUE, c = "oops")
save(x, y, file = "xy.rda")
load(file = "xy.rda")
```

- `saveRDS()`, `readRDS()` - saves/loads a _representation_ of the object
``` r
x <- stats::runif(20)
saveRDS(x, file = "x.rds")
x2 <- readRDS(file = "x.rds")
identical(x, x2, ignore.environment = TRUE)
```

.small[https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2012/04/01/saving-and-loading-r-objects/]

---
## R datasets

R contains many datasets (stored as data frames) that are built-in to the software

```{r}
data() # All built-in datasets
# ?trees
data(trees) # Load a particular one
head(trees)
```

---
## Accessing data in datasets

```{r}
attach(trees)   # You can make R find variables in any data frame by adding the data frame to the search path
search()        # .GlobalEnv is your workspace and the package quantities are libraries
detach(trees)   # To remove an object from the search path, use the detach()
with(trees, mean(Height)) # Evaluate an R expression in an environment constructed from data, possibly modifying (a copy of) the original data
```

`attach()` can cause name overloads and other serious issues. Avoid it
