## R history

- Elegant, object-oriented programming language.
  - Started by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka (hence `R`) in 1995 as a free, independent, open-source implementation of the `S` programming language
  - Currently, maintained by the R Core development team

- An extremely powerful language for statistical modeling, machine learning, data manipulation, and visualization.
  - Efficient data analysis
  - Optimized operations on vectors, matrices lists
  - Very sophisticated graphs and data displays

## Organizations behind R

- **The R project**, https://www.r-project.org/
    - R source code contributors: https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html

- **Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)**, https://cran.r-project.org/
    - Download and install R

- **RStudio**, https://www.rstudio.com/
    - Download RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop

## Bioconductor

"Is an open source and open development software project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data."

**Goals**

- To provide widespread access to a broad range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data

- To provide a common software platform that enables the rapid development and deployment of extensible, scalable, and interoperable software

- To further scientific understanding by producing high-quality documentation and reproducible research

- To train researchers on computational and statistical methods for the analysis of genomic data

---
## Advantages and disadvantages of `R`

- Free and easy to install

- Highly extensible through packages, collections of functions, data, and documentation

- Active developer community

- Anyone can contribute

- Some learning curve

- No centralized support

- Less consistency in function/variable naming and structure

---
## Install/update R

- Installation for Windows, Mac, and Linux is available

- New version of R is released every 6 month, typically around April/October
    - Bioconductor updates follow shortly thereafter

- Use `installr` R package to cleanly update R on Windows

## Run R

.pull-left[
- Command line. Type `R` and enter the R prompt
    - Type `R CMD` to see the list of available commands
    - Type `Rscript` to see how you can run R commands and scripts from the command line. E.g., `Rscript -e 'print("Hello, world!")'`

- R console, installs with R

- Rcommander. GUI for better interactions with R

.pull-right[<img src="img/RConsole.png" height=350 >

- RStudio. Integrated development environment for basic and advanced R operations
]

## RStudio

* RStudio is a program that allows you to run R in a more user-friendly environment
    * RStudio offers some GUI (graphical user interface) features for R

* RStudio is a very flexible IDE (Integrated development environment)
    * The same R program is running underneath the interface

* RStudio is open-source software (and therefore is free)
    * Available for download at: http://rstudio.com

## Why RStudio

- Project-centric work - scripts and data are organized in one folder (project), easily accessible 

- Single workspace with four (rearrangeable, zoomable) panels

- Work on multiple projects simultaneously in several instances of RStudio

- Work on multiple (types of) scripts

- See all variables in R environment, easily visualize them

- Easy access to help, plots, packages

- Simple integration with Git version control system

- **After you install R and RStudio, you only need to run RStudio**

## RStudio settings

- Set to "Never" the 'Save workspace to .RData on exit' option and uncheck the 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup' option in "Tools/Global Options/General"

.center[<img src="img/rstudio_options.png" height=500 >]

---
## RStudio settings

- In "Tools/Global Options/Code", check 'Enable code snippets', look what snippets are available and add your own. In the "Completion" tab, set completion delay to 0ms.

## RStudio settings

- In the "Saving" tab, set 'UTF-8' as default text encoding, to avoid character encoding issue between Windows and other operating systems

## RStudio is more than IDE

RStudio PBC develops many now-gold-standard R packages

- `tidyverse` – R packages for data science, including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and purrr

- `shiny` – An interactive web technology

- `rmarkdown` – Insert R code into markdown documents

- `knitr` – Dynamic reports combining R, TeX, Markdown & HTML

- `tensorflow` - open-source software library for Machine Intelligence

- `reticulate` - provides a comprehensive set of packages for working with Python

- `devtools` – Package development tool
